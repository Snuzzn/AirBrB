### UI/UX
- Consistent colour scheming and branding used.
- 'Home' button via AirBrB icon on top left of NavBar always available, for ease of navigation.
- Most significant elements given central positions, such as the search bar, with sufficient spacing for emphasis.
- Maintained visual hierarchy via font sizes and headings.
- Breadcrumbs and chevron icons used to facilitate traversal to previous pages.

### Accessibility
- `alt` tags used for images.
- Keyboard traps avoided so that keyboar dusers can `tab` through most elements.
- Used standard HTML elements, such as `form`, `button` and `input` rather than over-reliance on `div`.
- `aria-label` used on buttons without associated `label` elements, such as interactive icons.
- Used customary icons for interactivity, such as a magnifying glass for search, a half circle with an exiting arrow for logout, a trash can for deletion, and a pencil for editing.
